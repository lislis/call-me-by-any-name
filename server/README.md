# CallMeServer

Node Express + Websocket server

## For development

Have Node installed, and install dependencies with `yarn install`.
Copy and adjust the PORT in the .env file `cp env.sample .env`.
Run the server with `node server.js`.


## Production

We assume a production setup with Docker and docker-compose. See the toplevel [README](../REadme.md) for more information.
