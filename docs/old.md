## Development

For development you have to run several processes and a database.
Follow the [MongoDB installation instructions](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/) for a local setup of the database.
Then, adust the .env files in **foyer**, **server** and **botbrain** and run each process.
See the individual READMEs for more information and exact configurations.


## Production

We assume a production environment with docker-compose, take a look a the [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml).

Just a few words on what is happening:

üé≠ **UI** builds an image where all assets are served using NGINX, it exposes PORT 80 but we remap that to 8080.

üíÅüèº **Server** builds the socket.io and api server and talks to the database. Feel free to adjust the port it exposes (whatever is free on your server). This is the main logic service.

ü§ñüß† **BotBrain** builds an HTTP server to serve generated text form live users and fragments from the database. Therefore also talks to the database. Feel free to adjust the port it exposes (whatever is free on your server).

üèÉ **Runner** runs the script and sends requests to server.

üóÑÔ∏è **DB** the MongoDB service for storing stuff. What databases do.


### Prepare first run

Clone this repository on your server. Adjust your NGINX config and prepare SSL certificates. (depends on your setup) and add DNS. I'm using two subdomains, one for **foyer** and one for **server**.

Copy and adjust the .env for the **foyer** `cp foyer/env.production.sample foyer/.env.production`.

- `VUE_APP_WS_HOST` url configured in your NGINX for socket traffic
- `VUE_APP_API_HOST` url configured in your NGINX for web traffic
- `VUE_APP_LS_PREFIX` app prefix for local storage

In the docker-compose.yml adjust the exposed ports to free ports on you host.

Run `docker-compose up -d`. The first time it will build both images and pull the mongo image. That will take some time. Once it's done you can check the status with `docker ps`.

The **foyer** should now be available on the address you have configured!

Add two rooms to the database, so that user login works. You can use these curl commands:

``` bash
curl -i -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{ "room_name":"Writers Room", "main":true, "private":false }' localhost:3000/api/room

curl -i -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{ "room_name":"Stage", "main":true, "private":false, "locked": true }' localhost:3000/api/room
```

Run `docker-compose down` to shut down the services.
